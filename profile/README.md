# Vancouver Hack Space

The Vancouver Hack Space (VHS) is a volunteer-run, not-for-profit workshop where members share tools, equipment, space, knowledge, and good times.

This github organization holds code for the infrastructure of the space, as well as some member group projects.

Some important projects:

- [nomos](https://github.com/vhs/nomos) is our membership management system.
- [raffle](/vhs/raffle) helps us raffle stuff off on our discourse forum
- [vhs-laser-access](/vhs/vhs-laser-access) manages access to the laser (with help from nomos)
