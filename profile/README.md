# Vancouver Hack Space

The Vancouver Hack Space (VHS) is a volunteer-run, not-for-profit workshop where members share tools, equipment, space, knowledge, and good times. We are located in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

This github organization holds code for the infrastructure of the space, as well as some member group projects.

Some important projects:

- [nomos](https://github.com/vhs/nomos) is our membership management system.
- [raffle](/vhs/raffle) helps us raffle stuff off on our discourse forum
- [vhs-laser-access](/vhs/vhs-laser-access) manages access to the laser (with help from nomos)

But there are lots of other repos that might be of interest, including archived ones. If you are a member and would like to get involved, join the VHS slack channel `#vhs-dev-ops`. Archived repos can be un-archived if there is new work being done on them.
